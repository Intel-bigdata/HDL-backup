TensorFlow on YARN
======================
TensorFlow on YARN is a YARN application to enable an easy way for end user to run TensorFlow scripts.

Note that current project is a prototype with limitation and is still under development

## Features
- [x] Launch a TensorFlow cluster with specified number of worker and PS server
- [x] Replace python layer with java bridge layer to start server
- [x] Generate ClusterSpec dynamically
- [x] RPC support for client to get ClusterSpec from AM
- [x] Signal handling for graceful shutdown
- [ ] Package TensorFlow runtime as a resource that can be distributed easily
- [ ] Fault tolerance
- [ ] Code refine and more tests

## Quick Start Guide 
### Set up
1. Git clone ..
2. Compile [tensorflow-bridge](../tensorflow-bridge/README.md) and put libbridge.so to a place be aware to YARN application. For instance, JVM lib directory.
3. Compile TensorFlow on YARN

   ```sh
   cd <path_to_hadoop-yarn-application-tensorflow>
   mvn clean package -DskipTests
   ```

### Modify Tensorflow Script

1. TensorflowOnYarn have launched TensorFlow servers, so the  codes about start and join servers need to be deleted.     
         
    ```
    // the part of your script like the following need to be deleted                       
    server = tf.train.Server(clusterSpec, job_name="worker", task_index=0)      
    server.join()                   
    ```

2. Server.target should be a parameter of Tensorflow script.        
    
    ```
    tf.app.flags.DEFINE_string("target", "", "target url")
    ```

3. You need write a python script like job.py to parse Tensorflow cluster parameters and start Tensorflow clients. A example script like the followingï¼š

   [example job.py](https://github.com/Gnillor/HDL/blob/tensorflow-doc/hadoop-deeplearning-project/YARN-TensorFlow/hadoop-yarn-applications-tensorflow/job.py)

### Run  
Run your Tensorflow script. Let's assume a "job.py"

   ```sh
   ./bin/yarn-tf -job job.py -numberworkers 4 -numberps 1 -jar <path_to_tensorflow-on-yarn-with-dependency_jar>
   ```
   
   Note that at present, the "job.py" should parse worker and PS server from parameters "ps" and "wk" populated by TensorFlow on YARN client in the form of comma seperated values.
